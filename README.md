This is an **in-progress** importer for YNAB 5 (nYNAB) data. It doesn't work yet and I'm looking for community contributions to build it out.

Check out the [documentation for the API](https://actualbudget.com/docs/developers/using-the-API/), specifically about [importers](https://actualbudget.com/docs/developers/using-the-API/#writing-data-importers). All of the available methods can be found [here](https://actualbudget.com/docs/developers/API/).

See the TODOS in `importer.js`.

## To run it

Have Actual running locally and run `node index.js /path/to/data.json`
